# Developer-Code Relationship Extraction Project

This project focuses on developer-code relationship extraction research, containing two implementation schemes based on different baseline models.

## Project Structure

- `DCR Extraction Based on Baseline M1/` - Implementation based on baseline model M1
- `DCR Extraction Based on Baseline M2/` - Implementation based on baseline model M2
- `README.md` - Project documentation

## Module Description

### DCR Extraction Based on Baseline M1
- Uses the **first baseline model** for developer-code relationship extraction
- Contains complete training and inference workflows
- Provides model configuration and parameter tuning solutions

### DCR Extraction Based on Baseline M2  
- Uses the **second baseline model** for developer-code relationship extraction
- Contains complete training and inference workflows
- Provides model configuration and parameter tuning solutions

## Features

- **Relationship Extraction**: Automatically identifies associations between developers and code files/code snippets from code repositories
- **Model Comparison**: Provides two different baseline model implementation schemes
- **Extensibility**: Supports adding new baseline models or improving existing models

## Usage Instructions

For specific usage methods, please refer to the detailed documentation in each subdirectory:

- [M1 Model Usage Instructions](./DCR Extraction Based on Baseline M1/README.md)
- [M2 Model Usage Instructions](./DCR Extraction Based on Baseline M2/README.md)

## Experimental Results

Detailed results can be found in the paper.
